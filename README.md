# earthquake analysis project
#Magnitude of an earthquake is a quantitative measure of the amount of energy (in ergs) released by an earthquake.
#For shallow earthquakes, the magnitude, M, is defined as log of the maximum amplitude recorded on a Wood-Anderson
#seisomograh divided by the amplitude of a zero magnitude earthquake. This program uses this formula to compute the Peak amplitude 
#recorded by the Wood-Anderson seismograph considering the station to be at a distance of 100km away from the epicentre. Using a 
#magnification factor of 2800 the program computes the resulting Peak ground displacement.
